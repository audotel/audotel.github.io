		<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	
		<p>I am inspired by<a href="http://www.toga.com.au/"> http://www.toga.com.au/</a> and <a href="http://www.nerisson.fr/">http://www.nerisson.fr/</a> </p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p><strong>TOGA APARTMENTS:</strong> I really like the user experience for Toga aparments. When you first come to the page you are greated by beautiful imagery showcasing the properties with simple flat graphics detailing what you are looking at. This approach may not work for every implementation, but given the subject matter it really gives the user exactlly what they are looking for. I especially like the use of responsive design, so that the there is always a footer featuring the navigation. As you scroll the navigation anchors to the top of the screen and creates what feels like a basic header, but is simple and concise. I especially like the use of simple typography over the word "Toga" to help tell the company story.
		</p>
		<p><strong>NERISSON:</strong> This site is just awesome. I really love how simple the design is. It is primarily flat and graphic, but uses slight motion as you scroll to really bring to life the content. This is ideally very similar to what I was thinking for my own personal site</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different</h2>

		<p>Aesthetically these two sites accomplish very similar tasks using similar navigaton. Visually they definately come from different designers. The Nerisson site is clean, but still possesses character, whereas the Toga Apartments, is clean and doesn't have a lot of attitude.</p>
